Subject: Request for extension of deadline for project

Dear Internal Success Team,

I am writing to inform you about a family emergency that has arisen at my end and due to which I won't be able to meet the original due date for the task.

The original due date was tomorrow, but given the circumstances, I won't be able to complete the task by that date. I kindly request an extension of 3 days so that I can manage my personal situation and still be able to complete the task to the best of my ability.

I understand the impact this may have on the project timeline, and I assure you that I will do my best to complete the task as soon as possible. I also understand that you may need to make alternative arrangements, so I wanted to give you as much notice as possible.

I would appreciate it if you could let me know if this extension is possible. I would be happy to answer any questions or provide further information if needed.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

Manoranjan Sethi
